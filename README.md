# DSA-PROJECT
## AMAZON PRODUCT REVIEW ANALYSIS

### Company Context 

This project was completed as part of a Junior Data Analyst role at RetailTech Insights, an e-commerce analytics company. The goal was to analyze Amazon product and review data to uncover insights for product development, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used contains 1,465 records and 16 fields scraped from Amazon product listings. It includes:

* Product Details: Name, Category, Price, Discount, Ratings
* Customer Engagement: Review Titles, Review Texts, Review Counts
* Format: Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data

## Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel (for cleaning, pivot tables, formulas, and dashboard creation)
* Excel Pivot Tables & Charts
* Calculated Columns & Conditional Formatting

## Key Analysis Tasks

The following business questions were answered using Excel:

1. Average discount percentage by product category
2. Number of products per category
3. Total number of reviews per category
4. Products with the highest average ratings
5. Comparison of average actual price vs discounted price by category
6. Products with the highest number of reviews
7. Count of products with a discount of 50% or more
8. Distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)
9. Total potential revenue (actual\_price × rating\_count) by category
10. Unique products per price bucket: `<₹200`, `₹200–₹500`, `>₹500`
11. Correlation between ratings and discount percentage
12. Products with fewer than 1,000 reviews
13. Categories with products offering the highest discounts
14. Top 5 products combining highest rating and number of reviews

## Dashboard

An Excel-based interactive dashboard was created to visualize:

* Category-level summaries
* Top-rated and most-reviewed products
* Price vs Rating distributions
* Discount analysis and revenue projections

The dashboard is designed for intuitive, actionable insights tailored for Amazon sellers.

## Insights Summary

* Certain categories consistently offer higher discounts
* Products with more reviews tend to have higher ratings
* Revenue potential is closely tied to rating volume and price range
* Discount levels do not always correspond to better ratings

## Files Included

* `Amazon case study.xlsx`: Contains raw data, cleaned data, analysis tables, and the dashboard

## Status
